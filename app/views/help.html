                    <p>welcome to {{env.applicationName}}! Here's some quick info on how to get the best out of the application.</p>

                    <p>You can currently read basic book review information and comemnts entered by our members. However, you cannot post your own reviews or comment on the reviews of others.

                    <p>You currently have full permissons to be able to:</p>
                    <ul>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Note: the application doesn't allow you to get in touch with book reviewers directly e.g. you can't see someone elses email address.</p>

                <h3>How does it all work</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Someone signs up for the application and writes a review of a book they have just read</li>
                    <li>Some else who has signed up for the application reads the review and sort of agrees but they read it slightly differently. They reply to the review with a "comment"</li>
                    <li>Some else who has signed up for the application reads the comment and gets what the person was saying but sees it from a different angle. They reply with a follow on comment</li>
                    <li>... and the world continues to go round while we natter about books...</li>
                    <li>In the mean time, someone else reads the review and thinks &quot;<i>that sounds interesting - where can I find out more without borrowing the book from my neighbour?</i>&quot; Ah - happy days - there may be two options
                        <ul>
                            <li>Many book reviews on the application have a Google Books Preview link <img src="./images/gbs_preview_button1.gif" alt="Google Books">. If the book review has such a link, click it to read some or all of the book online.</li>
                            <li>Click the "Google Books Summary" tab to read the book review on Google. Caveat Reader - Google Books reviews vary in quality!</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>When entering a book review, the application will show a range of possible matches on Google Books (based on what you have typed in to the book's Title field). If you
                    scroll through the suggestions and click the displayed checkbox when the best match is shown, this adds the Google Summary and Google Preview functionality to your book review.</li>
                    <li>That's about it - that's all it does at the moment.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>T&amp;Cs</h3>
                <p>The web site T&amp;Cs are pretty short.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If writing a review or comment on the site, please remember that:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>While your name may only visible to other &quot;members&quot; of the site, anything you write in a review or comment is publically visible on t'internet and will, eventually, be slurped by Google. </li>
                        <li>If you logon, your name, picture (if any) and email address is read from Google or Facebook and your name and picture (but not email address) is visible to other web site &quot;members&quot; on any reviews or comments you make</li>
                        <li>Be nice - I'm told authors like Jeffery Archer and E.L. James regularly read the reviews on this site. Even your least favourite authors probably have feelings (and some, no doubt, can be litigious).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>When first logging on to the application you will be asked by Google or Facebook whether you are happy for {{env.applicationName}} to access your basic profile details (including your name, email address and picture). If you are <b>not</b> happy, say &quot;no&quot; - simples.</li>
                    <li>You can delete or update any book review you have written at any point. If you have commented on a book review and the reviewer deletes their review, your carefully written comment will head inexorably towards <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_device" target="_blank">/dev/null</a> - sorry!</li>
                    <li>You can delete (but not update) any comment you have left on any book review at any point. However, if you delete a comment, it will be shown as &quot;deleted by &lt;your name&gt;&quot; rather than completely removed.</li>
                    <li>Finally, {{env.applicationName}} is not responsible for the reviews or comments posted by web site members. However, we will immediately take down any
